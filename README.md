A small utility designed to check a list of domains for availability via HTTP, HTTPS, and QUIC using `aiohttp` and `aiosync`. It features fully asynchronous code. The project is more of a small personal project rather than a serious utility, and I am quite confident you will find more applicable tools. Please do not recommend this project to anyone lol.

## Usage
I personally use `uv`, by the way, a `requirements.txt` is also present for `pip` users.
```bash
uv run main.py
```
To learn about the various optional arguments, use the `--help` flag.
