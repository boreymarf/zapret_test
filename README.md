A small utility designed to check a list of domains for availability via HTTP, HTTPS, and QUIC using `aiohttp` and `aioquic`. It features fully asynchronous code. `zapret_test` is more of a small personal project for me rather than a serious utility to use, and I am quite confident you will find more applicable tools. Please do not recommend this to anyone lol.

## Usage
I personally use `uv`, a `requirements.txt` file is also present for `pip` users.
```bash
uv run main.py
```
To learn about the various optional arguments, use the `--help` flag.
